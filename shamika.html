        <p>So babe, 18 months. That's 7.4% of your life so far and 7.5% of mine. But you and I started way before 8th
            October 2020. We started when we would secretly hope Nikhil didn't come in the auto, when we would make sure to
            talk to each other every Thursday from 2-3 in the afternoon, when we would walk around for 20 minutes after
            coming back from Allen or just sit on the swings. You are honestly one of the few things that kept me sane
            during Allen. Since we never spoke about studies or marks or anything, talking to you was like a break from the
            shittiness of everyday life. I could talk to you about literally anything and felt so comfortable around you.
            Throughout the first year of Allen I felt alone, and then comes along this person who I love being with and
            talking to and who just gets me; and I soon realised that this person who at the moment is just as escape from
            the shittiness of my everyday life, is the person I want in my life for as long as I can and the person I want
            to experience everything with. Then we went into lockdown and spoke for a total of like 4 times over the span of
            five months. But even though we weren't able to talk, we still thought about each other all the time (yes I did
            think about you when it rained). Then advanced happened and we were finally done, but we still had no idea where
            we both were gonna go. But I'd waited long enough. Regardless of where we'd end up, in my mind there was no way
            we wouldn't be together. And so I asked you out on text(ya okay my bad), and you made me wait a day for your
            answer, but you finally said yes. </p>
        </br>
        <p>The first four months or so of us dating were so; it's like we knew we liked each other and were dating but were
            still getting to know each other. The talking stage except we were already dating. But during those four months
            is when I realised the extent of how amazing you are and just how I lucky I got, and that's just grown and grown
            since then. We then reached half a year, which was a huge deal for me cause it was already 6 times as long as my
            previous longest relationship. But the high of half a year wore off much sooner than I wanted it to cause you
            were in a different city and I couldn't see you for two months. This wasn't the first time we've been in a
            situation like this, but it was much harder this time. But like the last time we couldn't see each other for a
            long period of time, through all the times I felt like ccrying cause of how much I missed you, I realised I
            didn't just like you anymore and what I feel for you is something much much deeper. The first time I saw you
            after Hyderabad is when I decided I just can't hold myself back from fully expressing how I feel about you and
            that's when we had some pretty cool milestones like our first kiss and first I love you's. Things were going so
            good after that and even though we hit a small bump at the 9 month mark, we knew it wasn't anything we can't
            work through. And then we finally got to go to campus and be as free and independent as we wanted. </p>
        <br>
        <p>We then reached a year, one of the biggest and most special days of my life so far; my first year with my dream
            girl. We were lucky enough to expeience so many amazing things together; stars, Rishikesh, being able to spend
            nights together, being able to be with each other and cuddle at night. Everything we said we wished we could do
            on text, we were able to do in person. And in Delhi we reached another milestone, the ultimate level of physical
            intimacy and closeness. I can't fully tell you how happy the fact that my first time was with you makes me.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But of course, it's natural that things aren't always smooth and good. We went through something extremely hard,
            and something that put our relationship and bond to the test. The week we went on the break was easily one of
            the hardest things I've been through so far. Not being able to talk to or see my favorite person, my best
            friend, the one person I want to tell evrything good or bad was like torture. Even though we needed it and it
            was the right decision, it was still extremely difficult. But then again, it wasn't the first time we couldn't
            talk to or see each other. And like the previous times, apart from things about myself, the time away also made
            me realise the true extent of how close we are and how much we mean to each other. It made me fall in love with
            you all over again, and so much deeper this time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Shamika, you really are the best person I know. Your focus, determination and work ethic for evrything you do is
            something I admire so so much and I'm so very proud of you. You make me want to better everyday. Despite being
            as busy as you are, you still find the energy to give me as much time as you have, and you do so with so much
            joy. The care you give me, you make me feel so special and make me the happiest I've ever been. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The fact that I've been lucky enough to spend 1.5 years with you,my best friend, my favorite person, my dream
            girl and
            my love, is why these 1.5 years have been the most special and it makes me very excited for everything else we
            have
            ahead of us. I know it won't always be nice stuff, but I'm sure no matter what it is, we'll never stop trying to
            make it better. I love you. So so much. The most. Regardless of anything. Happy 18 months Shamika ❤ . </p>
